# Artificial-Vision
About the Project:
Overview:
Our system uses Artificial Intelligence to help the people who are visually impaired. It aims
to eliminate the challenges that they have to face in their day to day lives.
It uses a camera to sense the surroundings. In order to provide the blind people hearable
environment, this project focuses on the field of assistive devices for visual impairment people. It
converts the visual data by image and video processing into an alternate rendering modality i.e
audio, that will be appropriate for a blind user. Therefore, the use of artificial intelligence for
modality conversion, from the visual modality to another.
It not only helps the blind to be independent but also eliminates the possible threats that they
would have to face.
